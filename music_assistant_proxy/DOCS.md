This addon creates a proxy to a Music Assistant server run separately from Home Assistant so that you can have the benefit of access in the sidebar without running Music Assistant as an addon.

Note that this addon does not run Music Assistant itself.

Configuration
Option: server_host & server_port
Fill in the IP address and port (standard port will be 8095) of the Music Assistant server.

Support
Please open an issue if you need support.
