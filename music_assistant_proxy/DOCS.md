This addon creates a proxy to a Music Assistant server run separately from Home Assistant so that you can have the benefit of access in the sidebar without running Music Assistant as an addon.

Note that this addon does not run Music Assistant itself!

Configuration
server_host: Fill in the IP address of the Music Assistant server
server_port: Fill in the port number (standard port will be 8095) of the Music Assistant server
